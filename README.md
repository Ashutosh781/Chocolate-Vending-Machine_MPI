# Chocolate Vending Machine

Team submision of "Design project" component of Microprocessors and Interfacing course in Semester 2 of academic year 2020-21 in BITS Pilani K.K. Birla Goa Campus.

The detailed description of the actual proposed design is described in the [Project Report](Report.pdf).

[Project Design](Design.pdf) contains the detailed snapshots of the design.

[Datasheets](Datasheets) of the components used are also added.

For Proteus simulations **Proteus 7 Professional** was used. Proteus design files and .bin code can be found [here](Proteus_Files).

**Note:** There were a lot of assumptions taken and changes made from the actual proposed design to have a running simulation in Proteus. This was because of the limitations of the software. *Refer to the Report for more details.*
